# Automatic-Text-Summarization-of-Privacy-Policy-Segments
This is a project I developed over the course of several days for CS6760 - Privacy Engineering - at Northeastern University. There are three components: 
  1) a scraper, implemented in JavaScript with the Puppeteer library, for scraping segmented privacy policies from https://explore.usableprivacy.org/ 
  2) a Jupyter notebook containing an example of how to perform automatic text summarization of privacy policy segments using a topic modeling technique known as latent semantic analysis
  3) a research paper that summarizes the major work that has been done on segmenting/classifying privacy policies, and gives an overview of the work that I did to summarize pre-labeled privacy policy segments.
